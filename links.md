3. [FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) Documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html)
-> Official documentation for FUSE, a system that allows for custom file systems to be developed and run in user space. It details how FUSE works, its API, and provides guidance for developers on creating their own filesystems with it.

<h2 style="color:red">WEEK 04 ðŸš©</h2>
1. [Introduction to Pointers in C](https://youtu.be/f2i0CnUOniA?si=25NrFo8aG3WhUeD-)
-> This subject is central to understanding C and C++ programming languages. The video cover the basics of pointers, including pointer arithmetic, the relationship between pointers and arrays, and the use of pointers with functions and structures.

2. [Static Libraries vs. Dynamic Libraries](https://medium.com/swlh/linux-basics-static-libraries-vs-dynamic-libraries-a7bcf8157779)
-> This topic explain the differences between static and dynamic libraries in Linux, a key concept in software development. The content would likely explain how to create, use, and manage these libraries, and the advantages and disadvantages of each type.

3. [Segmented, Paged and Virtual Memory](https://youtu.be/p9yZNLeOj4s?si=9XxIvUA0XhOEzQoK)
-> This video describes how a segmented memory management system employs segments of different sizes. Concepts such as logical and physical memory are explained, as well as the use of secondary storage to provide virtual memory. 

<h2 style="color:red">WEEK 05 ðŸš©</h2>
1. [What is Virtual Memory?](https://youtu.be/2quKyPnUShQ?si=1dbEtRdRszZlear2)
-> The video explains fundamental aspects of virtual memory in computers, like the MMU, virtual addresses, and paging. It highlights how virtual addresses are mapped to physical memory addresses.

2. [Everything You Need to Know About Kernel Panics](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dont-panic-everything-you-need-to-know-about-kernel-panics/)
-> When encountering a "kernel panic" rebooting error, it's a measure taken by the OS to prevent further damage. This article provides safeguards to the system integrity.

3. [What is Thrash?](https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-thrash#:~:text=Thrashing%20is%20when%20the%20page,to%20be%20reduced%20or%20negligible.)
-> This article explains when we experience a page fault where a process tries to access a memory page that has not been prepared or is not in RAM, prompting the operating system to retrieve the page from secondary storage and swap it into RAM. This becomes problematic when such swapping occurs too frequently, leading to a state where the operating system is more engaged in managing memory than executing processes. 

<h2 style="color:red">WEEK 06 ðŸš©</h2>
